# Tech Xperience challenge

## Challenge description
In this challenge, the company asked to develop an image recognition software to recognize 4 different products. We were given a little set of pictures to make the prediction.

## Steps followed
### Image manipulations
It was clear that the set given was not enough to make an accurate model and the quality and background would also make it difficult. ThatÂ´s why I decided to crop the pictures to just show the product also, in order to have more images in our set, I decided to rotate all the images from 15 to 360 degrees in 15 degrees intervals. (you can find the method used in the image_man.py file)
